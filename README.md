# Overview

In the creation of this software, I am working to become more well-versed in asp.net and razor syntax

The web app that I created is a Movie Journal database. It allows for the user to create entries for movies and add in a journal entry supplying thoughts about the film.

The purpose of this software is to expand my knowledge of C# and its capabilities as well as providing a fun and interactive program to play with.

# Web Pages

The web app consists of a simple home page that welcomes the user, then links to the Movie database page. In this page, the user can view all the movies, and add, edit, display, and delete individual entries.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio in the creation of this software

This web app was created using C# and html with razor syntax. It uses the standard C# and asp.net libraries

# Future Work

* Create a better home page.
* Add an additional genre model so that multiple genres can be entered instead of just one.
* Create additional models to increase functionality, such as adding reviews and giving a rating.
